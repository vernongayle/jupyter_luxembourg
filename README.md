This is the repository for Transparent and Reproducible Social Science Research Workshop - University of Luxembourg October 2018


# Longitudinal Data Analysis for Social Scientists

## This is an AQMEN (Data Science for Social Research) repository for Longitudinal Data Analysis for Social Scientists

### Workshop (September 2018)

### A two day hands-on workshop led by Professor Vernon Gayle, University of Edinburgh.

### Rationale: 

Across the social sciences there is widespread agreement that longitudinal data provides powerful research resources.  Many books and courses on longitudinal data analysis are oriented towards statistics and they often lack adequate coverage of the common practical challenges associated with undertaking ‘real’ research. This workshop is specially designed for social scientists. It provides a brief and highly accessible introduction to quantitative longitudinal data analysis using Stata software
<br>

### Topics: 

The research value of longitudinal data <br>
Sources of longitudinal data <br>
Analysing repeated cross-sectional data <br>
Duration models <br>
Panel data models <br>
The workflow in longitudinal data analysis <br>
Getting started using Stata <br>
Practical exercises in longitudinal data analysis <br>


### Core Text:

The course will be supported by 

Gayle, V. and Lambert, P. (2018) What is Quantitative Longitudinal Data Analysis?  Bloomsbury Publishing.

### Files:

*_**WARNING!**_*


No research micro data will be distributed during this workshop.

The files required are available in this git repository.

Participants MAY NOT make copies of these files or distribute them.

The files have been specifically created by AQMEN for training 
and MUST not be used for social science research.

THE DATA ARE NOT REAL! DO NOT USE THEM FOR REAL ANALYSES!

We advise that participants galvanise their training experience and
work with 'genuine' data files which they can dowload legally from the 
UK Data Service (http://ukdataservice.ac.uk/ -
the old site is www.esds.ac.uk but you will be redirected).

At workshops where real survey datasets are used participants MUST sign 
a data access agreement.

Real administrative data are never used in training settings.
