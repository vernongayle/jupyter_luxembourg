# An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks – towards literate computing and reproducible research <br>
<br>

## This is an AQMEN (Data Science for Social Research) repository on Jupyter notebooks

### Workshop (October 2018) <br>

### A short workshop led by Professor Vernon Gayle, University of Edinburgh (UK) <br>

### Rationale 

Concern about the lack of the reproducibility of research persists across a range of academic disciplines. There is a general appeal for extra materials to be routinely provided alongside research publications which include sufﬁcient information for a third party to reproduce results without any additional information from the authors. Jupyter notebooks are an open source web-based application that enable researchers to author documents that include live code (e.g., Stata or R code), alongside data analysis outputs (e.g., modelling results, plots etc.), and documentation (e.g., narrative text describing and detailing the workﬂow. Jupyter notebooks have been used in Nobel Prizewinning high-proﬁle big science applications but are rarely used social science research. <br>
	
The focus of this presentation is getting started with Jupyter notebooks.  The concept of ‘literate computing’, which involves the weaving of research narratives directly into live computation, interleaving text and documentation with research code and results to construct complete and transparent workflows with the goal of communicating results will be introduced. <br>

The session will concentrate on four inter-related aspects of the workflow – accuracy, programing efficiency, transparency and reproducibility. It will demonstrate how Jupyter notebooks can be used to assist in currently underexplored areas such as research code sharing, producing rich visual outputs, markdown and documentation, portability, undertaking language agnostic data analysis.<br>
